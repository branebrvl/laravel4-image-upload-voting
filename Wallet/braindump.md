### To Do

- Install information
- Seeding information
- Scope of application
- Purpose of application
- Create complete project plan features and ideas


- Income vs expense
- Categories have an "essential" flag i.e. Food bill (essential) vs Clothes (not essential)

### Dashboard Overview ideas

- Mini widgets (past 30 days)
    - Income
    - Outgoings
    - Balance
    - Avg spending per day
    - Comparitors to last month

### Ideas

**Expenses**

Regular expenses should be either automagically recognised. An idea would be to show a future timeline of outgoings for the next ~30 days.

**Budgets**

Ability to set budgets for a certain categories based on your income. This should include any consisten expenses currently paid for.

**Loans**

Allow you to 'loan' money to people and track re-payments. I need this.

**Reporting Features**

The following reports should be available at any given time.

- Total money spent that is viewable by the application
- Current account balances
- Spending broken down by categories over time (monthly)
- Spending by day
- Income per day

Each report page / dashboard should be able to filterable using:

- Date ranges

*Moving forward I would like to be able to compare monthly reports with relative categorisation. I.e. I spent 20% less on fuel, 15% more on cake etc.*


**Export**

Data should be exportable into a lovely CSV format. HSBC for example do not allow data to be downloaded except for the current month.

On a similar note it might be nice to print a slick graphic based dashboard with charts into a PDF for an accountant.
